This program is just a way to learn and build upon the C language for myself.
It reads in team data from the NHL website and parses it as required, 
in order to later work with separate statistics as required.
It creates a separate structure for each of the 30 teams, for which each has
25 variables.

The calculation is based on the Pythagenpuck theorem that predicts chances for
a team to win, based on their Goals For Per Game and Goals Against Per Game.
The next needed step is to incorporate the winning/losing chances based on 
whether the team is playing at home or away.

Please do not judge as I am just learning :)
