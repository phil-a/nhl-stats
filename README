This program is just a way to learn and build upon the C language for myself.
It reads in team data from the NHL website and parses it as required, 
in order to later work with separate statistics as required.
It creates a separate structure for each of the 30 teams, for which each has
25 variables.

The next intended step is to create functions for existing parts (to simplify)
as well as to create new functions that will take the name of two teams and
return (based on a series of specific calculations) which is more likely to
win.
